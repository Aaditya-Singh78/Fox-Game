The device, resembling an egg, features simple interface buttons. Players nurture virtual pets through various life stages, impacting their development based on care given.

### History
  Invented as a virtual pet simulation game, Tamagotchis were initially marketed to teenage girls in Japan. The concept originated from a desire to explore life on Earth through an alien species' perspective. Successive models introduced new gameplay elements and designs.

### Gameplay

Pets can fall ill if neglected, requiring care to prevent death. The life cycle progresses through stages like Baby, Child, Teenager, Adult, and Special, influenced by player actions.

### Features
  Recent models offer enhanced features like earning currency, connecting with other devices for interaction, and marriage and offspring mechanics. The introduction of augmented reality in newer models expands gameplay possibilities.

### Releases
  Tamagotchi versions evolved over time, with various themed releases and enhancements. The franchise continued innovating with each iteration, adapting to changing trends and technology.
